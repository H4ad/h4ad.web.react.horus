# Horus

With Horus you can see the hours launched by a person on each day of the year in a beautiful calendar, each day is colored to help you see if the user has reached the goal or if he has missed a few hours on that specific day.

You can click on each day to see what tasks those hours were related to and see how long those tasks lasted. If you need to fix a problem that day, by clicking on the task, a modal starting on Monday is presented to you to edit that specific task.

In addition, you can export hours for each user on one or more panels that you have selected, and if you need the hours exported for the entire panel, go to the "Exports" tab and export the tasks for each user of the panels selected in CSV, Excel or JSON.
